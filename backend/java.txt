KEYWORDS
- Static
  - applies to the class itself, not to specific instances of the class
  - static variables
    - can only be accessed on the class, not on any instance
  - static methods
    - can only be called by the class, not any instance

OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
- 

JAVA PLATFORM
- Platform Independent (build once, run anywhere)
  - jar file can be run on windows/mac/linux (with JVM installed)
  - .java code gets compiled to .class files which contain byte code which JVM can convert to executable code for OS
- JDK(JRE(JVM))
  - JDK 
    - javac, jar, debugging tools, javap
    - used to compile/debug Java 
    - used by devs to have full functionality to compile, debug, and run Java code
  - JRE
    - java, javaw, libraries (core java code/libraries)
    - Used to run Java program
  - JVM
    - Just-In-Time Compiler (JIT)
    - converts complied bytecode into executable code
- ClassLoader
  - For a program to run the JVM uses the ClassLoader to load all classes needed
  - 3 class loaders
    - system class loader: loads all classes from CLASSPATH (classes you write)
      - CLASSPATH
        - searches all jars found at classpath location
    - extension class loader: loads all classes from extension directory (classes from frameworks/dependencies used)
    - bootstrap class loader: loads all classes from Java core files (classes from Java system)

WRAPPER CLASSES
- wrappers wrap around basic primitive variable types to give it characteristics/methods of an Object (ie Int -> Integer)
- Boolean, Character, Byte, Short, Long, Integer, Double
- Autoboxing
  - automatic conversion Java compiler makes between primitive types and their corresponding object wrappers
- Casting
  - to convert one data type to another
  - implicit casting: done by compiler
  - explicit casting: done by code
    - int intNum = (int)longNum  //casts long to int

STRINGS
- All strings are immutible objects, if changed a new instance is created
- many String methods return the new String
- StringBuffer
  - allows same string to be modified so new instances dont need to be created
  - can improve performance if many changes needed (loops, etc)
- StringBuilder
  - similar to StringBuffer except is faster but not threasafe
