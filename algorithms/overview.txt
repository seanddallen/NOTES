Definitions:
- Palindrome: same both ways (abc, cba)
- Anagram: use same characters, in same quanitity, but different orders (abc, bac)
- Fibonacci: each number in the sequence is the sum of two numbers that precede it (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34…)
- Factorial: multiply all whole numbers from our chosen number down to 1 (4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24)
