Definitions:
- Palindrome: same both ways (abc, cba)
- Anagram: use same characters, in same quanitity, but different orders (abc, bac)
- Fibonacci: each number in the sequence is the sum of two numbers that precede it (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34…)
- Factorial: multiply all whole numbers from our chosen number down to 1 (4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24)


Problem Solving Steps
- Basic
  - Understand Problem
    - Restate in own words
    - What are inputs/outputs
  - Explore Examples
    - Test cases: simple inputs, complex inputs, no inputs, invalid inputs
  - Break Down
    - Write out the steps
    - Solve/Simplify
    - Do what you know, then incorporate the difficult
    - Refactor
  - Come up with brute force algorithm
  - Optimize 
  - Walk through the algorithm

Problem Solving Patterns
- Frequency Counter (usually O(n))
  - Pattern that uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
- Multiple Pointers
  - creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move toward the beginning, middle, or end based on a certain condition
  - setup to "references" or starting points in the array/string
- Sliding Window
  - creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another
  - depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created)
  - very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string
- Divide and Conquer
  - Pattern that divides a data set into smaller chunks then repeats process with each subset of data
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Backtracking

Data Flow Questions:
- Draw stuff and talk!
- Design database
- Design User interface
- Strategy
    - Identify 2 core features
    - Possible implementation
    - Address difficulties
    - Scaling solutions
    - Caching data
    - Request from database once, then store in cache 
    - Server architecture/deployment options
    - Use load balancer
